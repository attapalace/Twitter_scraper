# Twitter_scraper
Scraper streamlit app to scrape tweets with no limits

for the Scraping_data_program.py i used the dev version of snscrape by installing it using 
pip install git+https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape.git

With the development version, you can use the --jsonl argument, allowing you to access information directly from tweets instead of just tweet URLs, and to show the tweet content but this version can't be deployed with streamlit 

so for the Scraping_data_program2.py i used the last stable version to deploy it but it gets only the urls and count of tweets, but it has been deployed using this link https://share.streamlit.io/attapalace/twitter_scraper/main/Scraping_data_program2.py
